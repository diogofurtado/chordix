# Chordix
Chordix is a beta project developed in JavaScript using [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/)
on Web Audio API that allows to users to execute guitar musical notes from chords in HTML format.

The application focuses on singers to produce vocal self-development where barriers such as learning in an instrument can be difficult, 
instrumentalists unavailability for the development and playback dependency.

# Take a virtual guitar, turn up the volume and enjoy!
